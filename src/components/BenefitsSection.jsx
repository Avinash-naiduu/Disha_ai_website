              The National Education Policy (NEP) prioritizes enhancing teaching quality, positioning teachers as
              catalysts for transformative change. DISHAAI's Skill Assessment Program plays a pivotal role in this
              endeavour. By identifying areas where students require exploration beyond their curriculum and subjects
              needing additional support, our program empowers teachers to tailor instruction, nurture unique strengths,
              and address knowledge gaps. This targeted approach enables teachers to elevate student academic performance,
              ultimately enhancing their own professional growth and reputation within the school community.
